<blockquote><p>
And what are we doing about this constant and inevitable knocking at the door of Europe? How do we reflect the truth that an undeveloped population – blessed or perhaps cursed with modern communications – will strike out for a better life in the developed world. We confront the problem with an unedifying hotchpotch of neuroses and political spasms that ensure we never truly see it in the round, never discuss it rationally and never get to grips with it.</blockquote>

“The limited range and border enforcement mandate of Operation Triton are no substitute for Mare Nostrum. If the EU is serious about preventing future tragedies, it needs to give Triton the mandate and resources to rescue boats throughout the Mediterranean”, said Judith Sunderland, Senior Europe Researcher at Human Rights Watch.</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
The level of desperation among many of those involved, fleeing war, persecution and violence, including from Syria require our concerted efforts to respond. This trend began in June and July last year, before Mare Nostrum was established, and has continued in 2014. In addition, an increased number of women, children, including many unaccompanied, and elderly people are taking to dangerous sea routes. They face greater risks, are more vulnerable to abuse and have specific needs that require assistance after they are rescued.

While saving lives is an absolute priority in in all maritime operations coordinated by Frontex, the focus of Joint Operation Triton will be primarily border management.

“Everyone was horrified at the loss of lives off Lampedusa one year ago. Italy did something about it. Now this life-saving Mare Nostrum operation is at stake. Refugees, many fleeing war in Syria and oppression in Eritrea, cannot stay in lawless Libya and it is not possible for them to reach a safe place legally and safely. If Mare Nostrum ends without being replaced by a well-resourced operation whose priority is to save lives, more people will die in their attempt to reach our shores. A European effort is urgently needed, if the EU is really serious about putting an end to the deaths in the Mediterranean,” said ECRE’s Secretary General Michael Diedring.
<p>
While Mare Nostrum operates in international waters, the joint Frontex operation Triton, scheduled to begin on 1 November, will only be active within 30 miles off the Italian coast. Triton operation will have a budget of 2.9 million euro per month, only a third of the Mare Nostrum operation.

<blockquote><p>
EU:s otillräckliga räddningsstyrka Triton, som ersatte Mare Nostrum, är alltså helt medvetet mer begränsad. Uppdraget är inte enbart att rädda liv, utan att också bevaka EU:s gränser. Frågan är dessutom om EU:s medlemsstater verkligen vill ha en gemensam asyl- och flyktingpolitik, eller om det bara är vackra ord. Just nu skyller länderna mest på varandra.

<blockquote><p>
The risk to life when transferring migrants between ships at sea is significant; and the merchant marine is of course far from happy. Operation Triton, however, cannot be expected to handle the migrant challenge alone. It has two aircraft and a helicopter at its disposal, two open sea patrol vessels, and four coastal ones: a fleet appropriate to its mandate, which is to control the EU’s borders, not to police 2.5 million square kilometres of the Mediterranean. Triton’s budget, at €2.9m a month, is one third of what Italy were spending on Operation Mare Nostrum. That said, saving lives is always a priority for Frontex. “There is great suffering out there, among a great many vulnerable people,” says Gil Arias Fernandez, Frontex Executive Director “so of course we do whatever we can.”
