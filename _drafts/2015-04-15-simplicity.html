<aside class=intro>
<p>
All software is too complicated. It makes people confused and
angry. If you distribute software, please make it simple.</p>
</aside>

<p>
Every time I install some new thing to try it out, I'm assaulted
with a ridiculous amount of useless complexity. Then I spend an hour
removing a bunch of crap. Even things that are marketed as simple come
loaded to the hilt with unnecessary stuff. Please stop this.

<p>
To make this blog, I decided to go with Jekyll, since it's supposed to
be a very simple static file generator. I don't know why I didn't just
use a Makefile. Since I don't want to use somebody else's idea of a
default theme for my own website, I had to remove a lot of weird
stuff.

<p>
Don't assume that my simple blog needs a CSS preprocessor. I don't
need a magic grid-based bootstrap layout or whatever. Don't make me
deal with this kind of junk. I'm a professional web developer, so I've
had to learn how to recognize and eliminate weird bloat, but if I were
just getting started with web development, there's a risk that this
would be the last drop.

<p>
Or it would make me believe that CSS must be complex. My mom likes to
make web sites, and she found it pretty intuitive back in the days,
but after accidentally looking into the CSS for some WordPress theme,
she's all but given up on hand coding. It doesn't have to be like this.

<p>
The web world is perpetually going crazy with a proliferation of
transpilers, frameworks, ad hoc abstractions, toolchains, build
systems, and so on.
